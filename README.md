# Autocut

This tools detect silence sections in videos and create a FcpX timeline with the video and audio cut accordingly.

â„¹ It does not suppress quiet sections, it only cut them and separate them on a second video track.

## Usage

Two versions are available:

### CLI

```shell
autocut-cli [-h] [--audio-file AUDIO_FILE] [--min-length MIN_LENGTH] [--margin MARGIN] [--threshold THRESHOLD] input_path
```

- audio-file: Override audio tracks used for silence detection and timeline cuts. Can be used multiple times.
- min-length (default=`1.0`): The minimal duration of a quiet section in seconds. 
- margin (default=`5`): By how many frames non-quiet cuts are extended. Prevents sudden audio cut. 
- threshold (default=`-60`): At which Db level a section is marked "quiet". Should always be negative. 

### GUI

```shell
autocut
```

In this mode, you only choose which file to process, all other options use default settings.
